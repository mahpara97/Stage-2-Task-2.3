# 1. **Calculate ΔM for WT and Mutants**
#    - We calculated the metabolic response difference (ΔM) by subtracting
#      the metabolite levels in the 24-hour pesticide treatment from the DMSO control.

# 2. **Scatter Plot of ΔM for WT vs Mutants**
#    - A scatter plot was generated where each point represents a metabolite,
#      with ΔM for WT on the x-axis and ΔM for mutants on the y-axis.

# 3. **Fit a line with y-intercept = 0 and slope = 1**
#    - The fitted line `y = x` (solid diagonal line) was added to the scatter plot.

# 4. **Calculate residuals from the fitted line**
#    - The residuals were computed as `residuals = delta_mutant - delta_WT`.

# 5. **Color metabolites based on residuals**
#    - **Grey:** Metabolites where residuals are within ±0.3.
#    - **Salmon:** Metabolites where residuals are outside ±0.3.

# 6. **What are these metabolites? Trends?**
#    - Outlier metabolites with large residuals were identified.
#    - A trend was observed where some metabolites had much higher ΔM in
#      mutants compared to WT (above the y=x line), while others showed 
#      the opposite (below the y=x line).
#    - This suggests that the mutant may have **deregulated** metabolism,
#      affecting specific pathways more strongly.

# 7. **Plot time-course data for 6 outlier metabolites**
#    - Time-course plots were created for 6 metabolites that had large residuals.
#    - WT and Mutant data were plotted over **0h, 8h, and 24h**.

# 8. **What do the time-course plots show?**
#    - Some metabolites show a **drastic difference** between WT and Mutant.
#    - Certain metabolites exhibit a **strong increase or decrease** over time in mutants, 
#      suggesting a mutation-driven impact on metabolism.
#    - These trends could indicate which metabolic pathways are most affected 
#      by the mutation, potentially revealing **new biological insights**.

# Proteins structures are known to be strongly connected to their functions. However, at the amino acid level, not all amino acids contribute to
# structure and function equally. Galardini and colleagues decided to investigate the impact of all possible individual, non synonymous nonsense mutations on the structure and function of protein.
# The functional impact was computed as SIFT scores and the structural impact was calculated as FoldX Score (in kCal/mol).
# Import both sift and foldx datasets;

# In both datasets, create a column specific_Protein_aa which will be a cantenation of the Protein and Amino_acid columns such that If you have Protein A5A607 and Amino_acid E63D, you have specific_Protein_aa A5A607_E63D
sift_dataset1$specific_Protein_aa <- paste(sift_dataset1$Protein, sift_dataset1$Amino_Acid, sep = "_")
foldx_dataset1$specific_Protein_aa <- paste(foldx_dataset1$Protein, foldx_dataset1$Amino_Acid, sep = "_")
# Using the specific_Protein_aa column, merge sift and foldx dataset into one final dataframe.
new_mergeddata <- sift_dataset1 %>%
  dplyr::left_join(foldx_dataset1, by = join_by(specific_Protein_aa))
# According to the authors;A SIFT Score below 0.05 is deleterious and A FoldX score greater than
# 2 kCal/mol is deleterious. Using the criteria above, Find all mutations that have a SIFT score below 0.05 and FoldX Score above 2
# (i.e: Mutations that affect both structure and function)
# Filter mutations that meet the deleterious criteria
deleterious_mutations <- subset(new_mergeddata, sift_Score< 0.05 & foldX_Score > 2)
# Print the result
print(deleterious_mutations)
# Study the amino acid substitution nomenclature
# Investigate for the amino acid that has the most functional and structural impact.
# Hint: Using the amino acid column, find a way to select the first amino acid. Solution here.Generate a frequency table for all the amino acids. Use table() to get the frequency table
# Extract the first amino acid from the Mutation column
deleterious_mutations$AA <- substr(deleterious_mutations$Amino_Acid.x, 1, 1)
# Generate a frequency table for the first amino acids
aa_frequency <- table(deleterious_mutations$AA)
# Print the frequency table
print(aa_frequency)
# Using the amino frequency table above, generate a barplot and pie chart to represent the frequency of the amino acids.
barplot(aa_frequency,col=aa_frequency)
pie(aa_frequency,col=aa_frequency)
# Briefly describe the amino acid with the highest impact on protein structure and function
# Glycine (Gly/G) is the amino acid with the shortest side chain, having an R-group consistent only of a single hydrogen. 
# As a result, glycine is the only amino acid that is not chiral. Its small side chain allows it to readily fit into both hydrophobic
#and hydrophilic environments.This allows for greater flexibility in protein folding and enables it to fit into tight spaces within a protein structure that other amino acids cannot.
# What can you say about the structural property and functional property of amino acids with more than 100 occurences.
# Amino acids with more than 100 occurrences play crucial structural and functional roles: hydrophobic residues
# (A, F, I, L, V, W) stabilize protein cores, while flexible residues (G, P) influence loops and turns, and polar/charged residues (D, Q, R, S, T, Y) contribute to enzymatic activity
# and interactions. Functionally, these amino acids are essential for protein folding, stability, binding interactions, and post-translational modifications, making them critical for both structure and function.

##NHANES is a program run by the CDC to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US.
##It combines survey questions and physical examinations, including medical and physiological measurements and laboratory tests,
##and examines a representative sample of about 5,000 people each year.
